# Draggable rectangle in OpenCV
Draggable rectangle using OpenCV (mouseCallBack function ) and C++.
Image is obtained through conected webcam.
This program also extracts the Region of Interest(ROI) inside of rectangle.

When I needed a feature like this I was a newbie in OpenCV and I could not find any implementation on the internet, except Python.
So, here, I implemented it in a simple way.
